  <h1>Ankita ♥ Mihir</h1>

  <div class="letter">
    <h2>Letter One</h2>
    <p>
      Ankita,  
      I don’t know when it happened, but somewhere between our conversations,
      your laughter became my favorite sound. You walked into my life so
      naturally that I didn’t realize I was falling, until I was already home.
      With you, I don’t have to pretend, I don’t have to hide, I don’t have to
      be anything other than myself. You make even the simplest moments feel
      meaningful, and even silence feels warm when it’s with you.
      Loving you feels calm, safe, and deeply right.  
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <h2>Letter Two</h2>
    <p>
      Loving you has taught me patience, softness, and courage. You inspire me
      without trying. Your kindness, your strength, and the way you care so
      deeply about people around you makes me admire you more every day.
      You make me want to be better, not because you ask, but because you
      deserve the best version of me. If love had a face, it would look like
      you smiling without realizing how beautiful you are.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <h2>Letter Three</h2>
    <p>
      Ankita, you are my peace in chaos. When the world feels heavy, you make
      it lighter. When life feels uncertain, you feel like certainty. With
      you, I’ve learned that love doesn’t have to be loud to be powerful.
      It can be gentle, steady, and deeply reassuring. I choose you in
      every moment, in every version of the future I imagine.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <h2>Letter Four</h2>
    <p>
      There are a thousand things I love about you, but what I love most is
      how real you are. Your honesty, your emotions, your dreams. You don’t
      just exist in my life, you add meaning to it. Every memory with you
      feels like a chapter I want to read again and again. You are my
      favorite story, and I never want it to end.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <h2>Letter Five</h2>
    <p>
      If I could promise you one thing, it would be this: I will always stand
      by you. Through happiness, through challenges, through everything life
      brings. I don’t want a perfect life, I want a real one, with you.
      Loving you is the easiest decision I’ve ever made, and choosing you
      every day will always be my favorite choice.
    </p>
